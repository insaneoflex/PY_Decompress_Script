# PY_Decompress_Script

The defined variables at the top are unnecessary for the script. I was using them to learn string substitution. 

This script was built to complete a CTF. The challenge was to decompress a file that was compressed 1000 times and in random file formats. It looks at the file name to decide
how to decompress and loops 1000 times. 

Next step was to try with a regex to learn more about that.
